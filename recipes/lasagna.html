    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>An <strong>excellent</strong> lasagna recipe, great ragu and bechamel. Awesome!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 lbs. ground pork</li>
        <li>1 lb. ground beef chuck</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>2 oz. pancetta or slab bacon, chopped</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 celery stalk, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 medium carrot, peeled, finely chopped</li>
        <li>6 garlic cloves, sliced</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp. tomato paste</li>
        <li>3/4 cup dry white wine</li>
        <li>1 28-ox. can whole peeled tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 cup low-sodium chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 225°. Mix pork and beef with your hands in a large bowl; season generously with salt and pepper, then mix again. Form into about 18 large meatballs (they don’t need to be perfect—you’ll be mashing them later).</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high. Working in 2 batches, cook meatballs, turning occasionally and reducing heat if bottom of pot looks in danger of scorching, until browned all over, about 6 minutes per batch. Transfer to a rimmed baking sheet as they’re done.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to medium. Add pancetta and cook, stirring often, until lightly browned and beginning to crisp, about 5 minutes. Add onion, celery, carrot, and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, 6–8 minutes. Add tomato paste and cook, stirring constantly, until paste darkens, about 2 minutes. Add wine and cook, stirring occasionally, until nearly completely evaporated, 4–5 minutes. Add tomatoes, crushing with your hands, and increase heat to medium-high. Cook, stirring occasionally, until liquid is jammy and reduced by about half, 8–10 minutes. Add broth and milk and return meat to pot. Bring to a simmer. Cover pot, leaving lid slightly ajar, and transfer to oven. Bake sauce (no need to stir, but check after 1–2 hours to ensure liquid is at a low simmer, adjusting oven temperature as needed) until meatballs are falling-apart tender, 3–4 hours.</li>
        <li>Using a potato masher, break meatballs apart and incorporate into liquid (you should have about 8 cups ragù); season with salt and pepper. Reduce over medium-low heat if needed to thicken.</li>
    </ol>
